# Tracking Contact Replacement

Keeping track of the most recent time your contacts have been replaced can be an annoying task. Creating a recurring calendar event can work, but is quickly thrown off when you tear a contact in the middle of a cycle or need to replace it early.

This is a simple app that tracks how long it's been since a contact replacement. Whenever contacts are replaced simply click the "Changed Contact Today" button.
